            <p>Technology sales teams have a wide range of responsibilities on a day-to-day basis.
                And it’s all with one goal in mind—to connect their customers with solutions.
                Tech sales reps must have extensive knowledge on the product they’re selling.
                IT sales and technology sales look similar on the surface. Both involve working with clients to find any
                challenges they might be facing and designing a set of hardware and software that can solve these issues.
                However, IT salespeople place their focus on assisting the client after they close the sale.</p>
